    <p class="work-des"># Paintitude<br> Paintitude is both a convenient toolkit and a eco-friendly services system. We meant to create a well-designed renting service in order to make good use of our precious resources. We also redesigned the painting tools for the sake of better painting experience. Our final goal is to provide a better choice for the customers in the field of painting. It is our hope that changing the color of the walls won’t be so troubling anymore.</p>

    <p class="work-des"># Features<br> Although there are many pieces in this set, all of them can be assembled onto the painting tray and turned into the form of a toolbox. Our design includes painting tray, brush, roller, replacement box (which includes replacement bristles, fabric roller cover, and tapes for cover), and replacement paper. All the tools that have direct contact with the paint are replaceable. This will decrease the difficulty of cleaning, and also extend the effective period.</p>

  <div class="container work-space">

    <p class="work-des"># Painting Tray<br>There is a slope at the back of the tray. The surface of the back of the tray, including the slope, is rough, so it won’t be so slippery to hold. The handle of the tray can lock the replacement box onto the plate. While painting, the handle can be used as a support, and the cover can hold the brush and the roller. Both the cover and the tray are covered with replacement paper for the sake of cleaning.</p>

    <p class="work-des"># Brush<br>With a 3 inches long paint brush, user can easily paint most of the areas and the edges. There are signs on the middle of the handle and the middle of the brush. The former one is the sign that reveals the appropriate areas for overlaping. The other is the sign that reveals appropriate areas for dipping the paint. Also, the bristle of the brush can be replaced when it is no longer suitable for use. Changing the bristle can be done by just simply open the lid and pull it out.</p>

    <p class="work-des"># Roller<br>With a 6 inches long roller, user can paint the walls efficiently. There is a sign in the middle of the handle to show the appropriate areas for overlaping. The fabric cover of the roller can be replaced by simply pulling it out. Also, The handle can be connected to a pole in order to paint higher places.</p>

    <p class="work-des"># Replacement Box<br>The replacement box can be put under the tray and be locked by the handle of tray when it is not in use. While using the toolkit, the user can put the replacement box aside for backup. There are 3 rooms inside the box which contain replacement bristles, fabric roller cover, and tapes for cover separately. The lid of the box can be fully opened, so it would be much more easier for users to take things out of the box.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="work-des"># Replacement Papers<br>The replacement paper is made by oiled paper. It can prevent the paint from contacting the products directly. The cleaning process will be much easier, more eco-friendly and less time-consuming. There are 3 layers put inside the tray and on it’s cover. The user can get a tray just like new by throwing away the first layer after using it.</p>
